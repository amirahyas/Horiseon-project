# Horiseon-project
This project was for me to practice working on using HTML semantic tags.
- My motivation for this project was being able to apply the skills I learned in order to complete this assessment.
- In this project I learned to better my HTML skills using semantic elements.
- From this project I learned how to properly use HTML semantic elements to make a website more accessible to users, how to format the amount of code in the codebase, and utilize comments to make my code even more eligible for other developers.
